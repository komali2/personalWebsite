        <p>I have been an avid writer since I was 5 years old, probably because I spent the better part of every math class reading
            books instead of paying attention. In order to keep my skills sharp, as well as to experiment with various SEO strategies,
            I maintain several blogs. </p>
        <p><a href=http://www.ablate.blogspot.com>Ablate</a><br><br> This is my main blog. Content includes how-to guides on the
            various minor lifehacks I've implemented, reviews of books, movies, products, and restaurants, travel diaries, and
            life ramblings. The purpose is to share the little tricks I've found to make life easier, products I've found enjoyable,
            and keep a living journal of my travels. Made in Blogger.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.taipeitips.blogspot.com">Taipei Tips</a><br><br> Born of my frustration over finding information
            to make my life easier as a foreigner living in Taiwan, this blog serves as a general guide for those new to Taipei.
            I implemented active and passive SEO strategies and the site enjoys a steady stream of about 10-20 hits per day.

        <p><a href="http://www.taiwanhikes.blogspot.com">Taiwan Hikes</a><br><br> Another Taiwan blog that came as a result of my
            own frustrations, this one focuses on some of my favorite outdoor activities in Taiwan. At the time I had been reading
            a lot of Tim Ferriss, and was looking to keep my blogs niche to drive traffic. Only passive SEO strategies have been
            implemented on the site and the daily traffic is healthy, appearing to mostly come from Google searches within Taiwan.

        <p><a href="http://www.komalistories.wordpress.com">Stories by Komali</a><br><br> Following the recommendations of
            several entrepreneurs, I wanted to give Wordpress a shot. This site serves as a testing ground for my fiction
            works to see how random people on the internet react. I've found the Wordpress platform good for sharing amongst
            other Wordpress bloggers, but in terms of passive SEO, the results have not been as good as they are on my Blogger
            blogs. </p>
