Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.

        <h3>Case 1: Publishers on Facebook</h3>
        <p>
          Facebook would overload feeds with content from publishers. Publishers became dependent upon FB
          traffic. FB waited, then reduced traffic. As it tightened the vice, it forced publishers to pay
          to have their articles actually show up, even to subscribers. Then, it forced publishers to 
          "pivot to video" to force its customers to fund its attempt to compete with Youtube. When customers
          had spent billions on this pivot, it decided videos aren't profitable, and killed the product, 
          and its customers along with it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Case 2: Slack
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://skyfall.dev/posts/slack">Hack Club</a> provides coding education and community
          to teenagers. The business was run on Slack. One day Slack sent them two bills: $50,000, due in a week,
          and $200,000 per year on top. Failure to pay within the week would result in 11 years of chat history
          being deleted and the server being shut down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another case, Slack raised prices to account for their new "AI features." Users that opted out
          of the AI features still pay the new prices.

         <a href="sign.dropbox.com/blog/a-recent-security-incident-involving-dropbox-sign"> April 24, 2024</a>:
          Dropbox hack leaks "customer information such as email addresses, user names, phone numbers and hashed passwords, in addition to general account settings and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication"
          of unstated number of customers.

        <h2>Self Hosting Intro</h2>
        <p>
          Self Hosting is when instead of paying a monthly SaaS bill for access to 
          a service, you deploy and manage a service yourself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's find some FOSS, self-hostable

          we discussed previously.
