                Bike Bounty is the AWS prize winning app at AngelHack San Francisco 2018, selected from among 200 projects. It is a 
                crowd-sourced asset retrieval solution for bike and scooter sharing companies, such as Lime, Ford Bicycle, or Bird. 
                The project team was composed of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-park/">Jordan Park</a>, 
                <a href="http://minjiportfolio.herokuapp.com/">Minji Lee</a>, <a href="http://www.albull.us/">Amanda Bullington</a>, 
                and <a href="http://www.calebjay.com">Caleb Rogers</a>. The project was conceived, designed, programmed, and deployed
                in about 10 hours of working time over 2 days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The premise of the app is that bike-sharing companies can either upload to our database, or provide their own API that exposes, 
                the last-known location of missing or damaged assets (bicycles, scooters). Users of our app can then access a map showing these locations
                on a live google map and attempt to find these assets. If they find an asset, they can then use our app to find the nearest dock or drop-off
                location to bring the asset to, allowing them to then collect a bounty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic system architecture has been established - using AWS Lambda, we can easily tailor queries to provide external API or our own database data,
                while being charged on a per-request basis rather than needing to maintain a server running 24/7. The React frontend allows quick frontend iterations,
                making it easy to plug in new features. The use of the Coord API allows us access to the locations of bike sharing company docks and other relevant 
                information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Future work on the app:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spin up a database for Lambda to query for missing assets. Create an API allowing companies to push missing asset data to that database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Discover existent missing-asset API for a bike/scooter sharing company, plug Lambda into it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement user accounts and authentication (front and back-end).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement "asset retrieved" functionality (possible separate frontends/pages)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement various frontend for bike/scooter sharing companies (upload missing bike info, manage users/bounties)
                    </li>
                </ul>
