              This is a Now page. It's where people put what they've been up to the last year. A now page is:
              <blockquote>
                  an overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year
              </blockquote>
              -- <a href="https://sive.rs/now2"> Derek Sivers</a>
          </p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
              I live in Taiwan, <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/posts/why-taiwan/">because I believe it's
              the best place to live on Earth for most people.</a>
              Things I like to do here include going to <a href="https://g0v.tw/intl/en/">g0v</a> hackathons,
              taking <a href="https://photos.thestinkytofu.com/s/3077wdc39i/portfolio">pictures</a>,
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR2K9vyQEBb4qUyunijtBHg">riding motorcycles</a> in
              the mountains, <a href="https://freesound.org/people/calebjay/">recording ambient sounds</a>,
              contributing to open source streetviews with Mapillary, riding ubikes on the riverside,
              coworking at cafes with people, and many other things.
          </p>
          <h2>Family</h2>
          <p>
              I'm engaged to be married, and my parents are planning to move to Taiwan this
              September. I care for a pet bearded dragon named Richard, and have several fish tanks. If you
              know any schools hiring teachers, my mom is an expert, and will be job hunting. If you know
              anyone that could use a laser scanning SME, my dad is an expert, and will be job hunting.
          </p>
          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
              For my engineering career, I'm split between running the co-op I founded,
              <a href="https://508.dev">508.dev</a>, and my own personal contracting / full time engineering
              work. We're always open to new members joining, and also have plenty of time available across
              our engineers for more contracting work.
          </p>
          <p>
              Ancillary to that, I've started a <a href="https://thejispot.com">restaurant in Taipei</a> with two other owners.
          </p>
          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>
              In the last year, I've had the following trips:
              <ul>

                  <li>Korea with my fiance</li>

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
              Since I have ADHD, I will always have too many hobbies I'm persuing at once, and the hobbies
              will always change. Right now:

          <h2>Philosophy, Ethics, Politics</h2>
          <p>
              I'm definitely even more obnoxiously leftist than the last time you talked to me.
