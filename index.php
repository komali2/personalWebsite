						<h2>Caleb Jay Rogers</h2>
						<h3>A bit about me</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p>My name is Caleb. I graduated with a Creative Writing degree from the
						University of Houston in 2013. I'm from Green Bay originally, but have
						made Houston my home. </p>
					<p>
						My interests include writing and programming. I intend to make a career
						out of the latter and dream to make a mildly lucrative hobby out of the former. 
						To that end, I will be attending a coding bootcamp in San Francisco starting in February.
					</p>
					<p>
						I live for travel. I am lucky enough to have experienced a variety of cultures in my travels, 
						and am proud that my efforts have landed me an intermediate Chinese language ability and a moderate 
						Japanese language ability. I have written about many of my trips at 
						<a href = 'http://www.ablate.blogspot.com'>ablate.blogspot.com.</a>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In the interest of self-improvement, I welcome all feedback to my work. 
						I wouldn't go so far as to call myself an expert in any of my studies, but
						I hope you can find what I've accomplished so far at the very least interesting. 
						Please follow the links above for examples of my writing and programming. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you have any questions, comments, or lucrative business proposals, please feel free to leave a comment
						on one of my blogs, message me on linkedin, or send me an email at rogersjcaleb@gmail.com.
