            Whoever is paying me at any given time has nothing to do with the

          <p>
            My name is Caleb Jay Rogers. I'm in my late 20s. I live in San
            Francisco. I'm a software engineer with a skillset primarily in
            web development, detailed below. I have a degree in Creative
            Writing from the University of Houston and four years of
            professional engineering experience.
            I'm not looking for a new position, but if you send me a job
            description I probably know someone that would fit that is looking.
            The best way to reach me is by email, and my address is
            caleb at calebjay (this website).

            Skills
          </h1>
          <p>
            My only form of income is from my job as a software engineer.
            I am extremely competent in all aspects of modern frontend
            engineering, including Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I am
            professionally experienced in the Javascript frameworks Vue.js,
            Backbone.js, React, and Angular 2, as well as the Python
            framework Django. I am confident that I can adapt quickly to
            whatever web framework is thrown at me. I am also experienced
            in the CSS frameworks Bootstrap 3 and 4, Materialize, and Google
            Material Desigh Components for Web (MDC). For proof, please
            follow links on my main page to some of my projects, scope my
            Github, or send me an email with more specific questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When building web apps, I prefer Vue.js as a framework, Webpack as a
          build tool, and deployment via Google App Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, I can engineer with the following tools and
          technologies with little to no assistance:
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML
            </li>
            <li>
              Web Accessibility (WCAG, 508)
            </li>
            <li>
              Javascript, ES5, ES6, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vue
            </li>
            <li>
              Webpack
            </li>
            <li>
              Python (2, 3)(I prefer 3)
            </li>
            <li>
              Backbone
            </li>
            <li>
              jQuery
            </li>
            <li>
              React
            </li>
            <li>
              CSS
            </li>
            <li>
              SASS
            </li>
            <li>
              LESS
            </li>
            <li>
              Angular
            </li>
            <li>
              Canvas and Canvas tools (Pixi.js, Fabric.js)
            </li>
            <li>
              WebGL (see Canvas)
            </li>
            <li>
              Querying and Deploying SQL databases (but not with the skills
              of a good DBA or Devops team)
            </li>
            <li>
              Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
            </li>
            <li>
              AWS Cloud Platform (Lambda, S3)
            </li>
            <li>
              Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Jest
            </li>
            <li>
              git, Github
            </li>
          </ul>
          Also, here's some technologies I know a bit about, and could probably
          figure out with some ramp up time:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Go / Golang
            </li>
            <li>
              Lisp
            </li>
            <li>
              Bash
            </li>
            <li>
              C
            </li>
            <li>
              Game Development
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I currently work full time at
            <a href="http://p.ota.to"> Potato.</a> Potato is a design and
            engineering firm based in London, Bristol, and San Francisco.
            I make projects for clients such as Google using technologies like
            Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Webpack, Vue.js, Canvas / WebGL,
            Python, Django, and other modern web development tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Potato, I was working as a frontend engineer at
            <a href="https://www.electricimp.com/">Electric Imp</a>,
            on their web-based IoT device management tool. We worked in
            Javascript ES5, Backbone / Marionette, and CSS. The build was
            prepared by Grunt and Gulp, and there were no unit tests (though
            we had a crazy good QA team for integration testing). While I
            was there, I spun up a Vue.js app from scratch to act as an
            admin portal for private cloud customers, and then ported our
            main app to a Webpack build system, adding capability for unit
            tests as well as our first unit tests on the frontend.
            This also allowed us to use ES6 / ES2015.
            I did this amidst the release of Webpack 4, and thus ended up firing
            off a bunch of random pull requests for various JS libraries
            that I regret not keeping better track of so I could brag about
            it here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Electric Imp, I was at first a student, and then a
            teacher's assistant, at Makersquare (which became HackReactor,
            which was then bought by Galvanize). That was an exciting time.
            I have blogged about the experience in several posts:
            <ul>

            </ul>
            Hm, I realize I should write up some blog posts about my time at
            the bootcamp - I'll do so soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Hack Reactor, I was an Engineering and Design recruiter
            at NES Global Talent in Houston. I was exploring a life path I
            thought I would be good at: sales. Either it didn't work because
            of the oil price dropping from around 100$ a barrel to around
            $40 after my first week, or because it's just not the life for
            me. I'm glad, now, that it didn't work out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my job as a recruiter at Hack Reactor, I was an English
            as a second language teacher in Taiwan, teaching people from
            ages 5 to adults. I have also blogged extensively about this:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.taipeitips.blogspot.com" >Taipei Tips</a>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was a kind of product manager, web developer, general
            English-speakin-dude-to-drag-around-trade-shows at BIG
            Entertainment, a distributor based out of Taipei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was head of the technical internship development
            program at AIESEC Taiwan.

            Professional Goals
          </h1>
          <p>
            I would like to solidify my web development knowledge. The gaps are
            mostly in devops type things such as inner workings of HTTP and DNS,
            as well as historical servers such as Apache.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a great deal to learn about web accessibility, and am
            attempting to start a business around consulting on web
            accessibility.
            Incidentally, it is a professional goal of mine to run my own
            business, possibly as a small part time venture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to learn a great deal about AI from a practical
            engineering standpoint as well as a scientific research standpoint.
            In striving for this very long-term goal, I am filling the gaps of a
            spotty and weird education by studying a lot of math.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to learn a lot more "native" engineering,
            such as embedded systems. I would like to one day learn
            Assembly for some instruction set, it doesn't quite matter which
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to get my EMT certification so I can volunteer
            part-time and help people.

           Values
          </h1>
          <p>
            All people are equal.
            Race, gender, and dynastic privilege exist currently and that is
            something that we should equalize.
            However, there is no scientific basis for race, and
            racists are stupid as hell.
            Nobody is above being questioned, nobody is so "high up" or of such
            a "wealthy class" as to be immune to justice or the questions of
            inquisitive minds seeking to improve themselves.
            Talent should be celebrated, disability should be assisted.
            All people should have mutual respect, except for the intolerant.
          </p>
          <p>
            People are inherently good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information should be free and easily accessed. In fact, it should
            be actively given to people that could find it useful. So therefore,
            efforts to hide, obscure, or obfuscate information are bad. This
            means I support libraries and the taxes that pay for them, the free
            software movement and the organizations that support it such as GNU,
            whistleblowers, journalists, grey-hat hackers, bio-hackers. This
            means I don't support efforts to suppress the free flow of
            information, such as many aspect of international copyright law,
            big pharma lobbying in the US government, whistleblower crackdowns,
            governments that restrict information and harm journalists such as
            the PRC, or highly expensive scientific publications.
            This means when I write code, I try to write <em>extensive</em>
            documentation as I do
            so, with the objective of my non-technical coworkers being able to
            read and understand what my code is doing.
            This means I prefer libre tools to do my work in such as Emacs and
            Linux.
            This means I love teaching.
            This means web accessibility should be first-class consideration
            when building a web application.
            This means that I welcome anybody and everybody to email me about
            anything they think I can help them with understanding better.
            Also, education should be free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Climate change is real and is the number one existential threat
            we face.
            This means I try to do my small part in avoiding
            climate-damaging activities.
            This means I prefer jobs in locations to which I can walk, bike or
            take public transit.
            This means I believe cars should be almost entirely banned inside
            most major cities (among many other reasons).
            This means I support public transit, bicycle lanes, and the taxes
            that support these things.
            This means I probably won't work for, or create applications for,
            climage-damaging corporations in industries such as Oil and Gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            People should be good to eachother and support eachother, and
            violence is almost never an acceptable solution to a problem.
            This means I support organizations such as the Peace Corps,
            Red Cross, CERT, and social welfare and the taxes that pay for it.
            This also means I am not a fan of pretty much every superpower
            nation in the world, including the USA, for their inexcusable acts
            of violence against innocents.
            This means that in general I won't do any work for any nation's
            military or military industrial complex, barring social welfare
            work.
            This means I believe the 2nd amendment of the US constitution should
            be abolished.
            This means I believe all militaries worldwide should be almost
            completely defunded and disbanded, barring their humanitarian
            branches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self determination is good. Violation of sovereignty is generally
            bad. This means I support the sovereign nation of Taiwan and reject
            efforts of the PRC to bring democratic Taiwan under its tyrannical
            rule. It also means I support a free Hong Kong. If you have fallen
            under the sway of PRC propaganda and believe Taiwan isn't a
            sovereign nation, email me and I'll help you understand why you're
            wrong.
            This means I believe various forms of democracy and rule of the
            people are the only valid forms of governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is short and should be enjoyed. This means I reject restrictive
            dogmas that demonize natural human pleasures. This means I celebrate
            good food, friendship, and happiness. This means I reject excessive
            materialism, but not entirely, as there is joy to be found in art,
            and many goods people would consider materialistic, I see as a form

            Currency and capitalism kinda suck but are probably necessary right
            now.
            That said, we should strive as quickly as possible for
            post-scarcity, and begin planning today for what we intend for
            humans to do when we no longer have to work to eat.

            I like writing, and I think everyone should write occasionally in a
            journal, or even just stream of consciousness. I'd like to write
            sci-fi novels eventually. I'm working on some now, but not with any
            discipline
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus obviously I really like reading, particularly sci-fi novels.

            I like learning about "baseline" or "origin" technologies. The siren
            call of Hot New Shit doesn't really do it for me. That means I like
            being the Emacs guy at work. I'm constantly trying to improve my vim
            skills (I use evil-mode in Emacs). I like learning about various GNU
            command line tools, though I still have a lot to learn. I prefer
            building simple, accessible, static webpages whenever the
            opportunity arises. If I can get away with it, I like to write web
            applications in plain old Javascript, although this is rarely
            possible. If I can really get away with it, I like building websites
            without any Javascript at all, although this typically just leads to
            me building whatever site in some sort of server-side rendering type
            tool such as Hugo or Django.

            I like playing videogames, sometimes. I'll often go weeks without,
            but then find myself rushing home after work to binge one. I have
            a <a href="http://blog.calebjay.com/tags/gaming/"> couple blog posts
            on the subject</a>. I also spend some time building games with my
            friend's <a href="https://sleepy.fish/#/">budding yet utterly
            without revenue</a> game development company.

            I'm starting to learn how to produce electronic music in Ableton. I
            enjoy it but am currently frustratingly bad at it. Here's my

            I like cooking and baking, and am damn good at both.

            I like growing plants, and I have a lot at home and around my desk
            at work.

            I really like riding motorcycles. I usually rent a motorcycle when
            I travel.
            So far I've ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam, around a bit in
            Japan, around a bit in the French and Italian Riviera, and around
            a whole lot of Taipei, Taiwan. I'd like to start a sort of Youtube
            channel where I talk about what I'm riding around as I motorcycle
            on a trip.

            I like learning languages. I speak a bit of Japanese and a bit more
            Chinese. I should study more. I have plans to in 2020, let's see
            how they go.

            I love traveling. I can sometimes feel stuck somewhere, and life
            seems very, very short. Traveling alleviates those
            feelings. Plus, I love food, and traveling is one hell of a way
            to scratch that itch.

            I'm idly into horology and am a slow-burning watch collector. Ask
            me again in 20 years whether my collection has anything noteworthy
            in it, right now it's a bunch of Citizen and Casio. Cool Citizen and
            Casio, but nonetheless. Oh, and one really sick old Japan-release
            Seiko, and a hunk of Soviet steel in the form of a Vostok Amphibia.

            I like meditating. I should do it more.

            I like lifting. I should do it more.
