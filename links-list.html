                    My recommendation is for those hardcore interviews to know Promises well enough
                    to implement them in vanilla Javascript.

                  A Github repo with a list of various types of libre software that you can host either on your own machine or on a VPS.
                  Many have very minimal server requirements, and so can be run off of raspberry pis or cheap rented VPSs. I love to
                  just browse this list in my spare time, and have probably something like 10 of these solutions. It's been a great way
                  to learn more about devops, the internet, linux, and general web engineering.
