            My name is Caleb. I live in Taipei, Taiwan. I'm a software engineer
            and founder. I have a degree in Creative Writing from the University
            of Houston and nine years of professional software engineering
            experience. Right now I'm growing a software engineering contracting
            and consultancy firm called
            <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>, organizing coworking events
            in Taiwan, writing
            <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com">blog posts</a>, doing various
            volunteer engineering work in Taiwan, and studying Mandarin. The
            best way to reach me is by email, and my address is caleb at
            calebjay dot com. For 508 related inquiries, that would be caleb at

            I'm able to do basically anything in fullstack at this point. I've
            yet to be presented with something I can't build, and I've built
            from scratch several startup's prod apps. I'm sure I'd stumble on
            building a super complex API or mobile app, but that's what LLMs are
            for :)
          </p>
          <p>
            When building, I prefer to keep things simple, and lately I've been
            a big fan of self-hosting or just chucking things on VPSs.

            Basically, I've spent the last 10 years working at various startups,
            except for 2 years working at a design and development agency, where
            we worked mostly on startup-style projects for Google.

            company, and before that, I was the VP of international sales
            development at AIESEC Taiwan. I have some old blogs from that

            My current largest focus is on striking the correct balance between
            leveraging AI tools to increase my productivity, while maintaining
            codebases of good quality and maintainability. This mostly just
            involves trying out every AI tool as it comes out for a couple weeks
            and taking a lot of notes. I'm really excited about ThePrimeagen's
            <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/99">99</a> tool. OpenClaw I
            also really like, but I've yet to find a way to make it very useful
            in without leaving gaping security holes that I'm not comfortable
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've founded a general software engineering LLC,
            <a href="https://508.dev">508.dev</a>, and I've been developing this
            business further to enable my team to reach a level of income that
            lets us begin spending time developing our own products or
            platforms. 2025 has been an explosive year for us in terms of
            revenue and new members. This year I'd like to develop alternative
            revenue streams, such as internally developed apps, games, or
            services.

            videos, as soon as I can find time to edit. I have a theory that if
            I focus on publishing on the fediverse, I can develop a small niche
            audience that's much more highly engaged than the larger audience
            one would try to develop on youtube.

            Information should be free and easily accessed. In fact, it should
            be actively given to people that could find it useful. So therefore,
            efforts to hide, obscure, or obfuscate information are bad. I
            support libraries and the taxes that pay for them, the free software
            movement and the organizations that support it such as GNU,
            whistle-blowers, journalists, grey-hat hackers, and bio-hackers. I
            don't support efforts to suppress the free flow of information, such
            as many aspect of international copyright law, big pharma lobbying,
            whistle-blower crackdowns, governments that restrict information and
            harm journalists, or highly expensive scientific publications. When
            I write code, I try to write
            <em>extensive</em>
            documentation as I do so, with the objective of my non-technical
            coworkers being able to read and understand what my code is doing. I
            prefer libre tools to do my work, such as Emacs and Linux. I love
            teaching. Web accessibility should be first-class consideration when
            building a web application. I welcome anybody and everybody to email
            me about anything they think I can help them with understanding
            better. Also, education should be free.

            Climate change is real and is the number one existential threat we
            face. I try to do my small part in avoiding climate-damaging
            activities. I prefer jobs in locations to which I can walk, bike or
            take public transit. I believe cars should be almost entirely banned
            inside most major cities (among many other reasons). I support
            public transit, bicycle lanes, and the taxes that support these
            things. I probably won't work for, or create applications for,
            climate-damaging corporations in industries such as Oil and Gas.
          </p>

            People are interconnected in the current era as well as to our past
            and future in an inextricable network. Attempting to assert a
            perfectly independent identity is a fallacy. This interconnectedness
            comes with a responsibility of mutual aid, or at the very least,
            mutual respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect of the inseperability of onesself from society is the
            fact that one's psychology is established in certain unchangeable
            ways from childhood. That said, culture and personality are still
            malleable. I'll engage in moral relativism to an extent, but I'll
            not compromise on my core values in order to validate someone
            else's, no matter the long history or culture that established those
            values. I'll also always try to maintain good grace, and I reject
            the notion that some people are "just like that," especially when
            that notion is used to imply that one region of people are all "a
            certain way." That's just racism with extra steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Violence is almost never an acceptable solution to a problem, but it
            is a valid last resort. In a revolutionary context, it seems violent
            tactics typically just invite the full might of a State's military
            and police response, getting a revolution squashed more quickly.
            Trying to use the techniques of imperialists against themselves
            intuitively feels wrong. The few times it works, it seems to
            establish just as violent and oppressive societies as the one that
            was overthrown, or worse: see the PRC and the cultural revolution
            for an example. For me, day to day, I can't think of any reason I
            would need to apply violence to any situation I'm reasonably likely
            to encounter, and will always strive to avoid doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Value" and "worth" are words that have been semantically overloaded
            by capitalists. Take for example "a person's value," in that sense
            the word is taken to mean a person's instrumental value (their
            ability to produce), moral worth, your personal attachment to them
            (e.g. you would "value" a family member more than someone in a
            different country), and how much of a given scarce resource should
            be allocated to them. We should stop using "value" like that and be
            more specific.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self determination is good. Violation of sovereignty is generally
            bad. I support the sovereign nation of Taiwan and reject CPC
            imperialist efforts towards conquering it. It also means I support a
            free Hong Kong. If you have fallen under the sway of CPC propaganda
            and believe Taiwan isn't a sovereign nation, email me and I'll help
            you understand why you're wrong. I reject all forms of imperialism,
            including those of Russia against Ukraine, the United States against
            Venezuela as well as basically the whole world, and Israel against
            Palestine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is short and should be enjoyed. I reject restrictive dogmas
            that demonize human tendencies. I celebrate good food, friendship,
            and happiness. I reject excessive materialism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capitalism isn't working to serve the needs of humans anymore. We
            should eliminate artificial scarcity, and begin planning today for
            what we intend for humans to do when we no longer have to justify
            our existence through labor. It seems nobody is planning for this
            inevitability.

            Everything ICE is doing in the USA is bad and it should be
            disbanded. That said, I have no hope for the USA to prevent itself
            from sliding into full fascism, and so my goal is to never step foot
            there again.

            The CPC is engaging in Han Chauvinism and attempting to create a
            State Race that in English it calls "Chinese" and in Mandarin it
            calls "華人." If you consider yourself "Chinese," I challenge you to
            consider what your identity means to you if you leave aside
            considerations of State or government. Do you believe the CPC has
            the right to decide for you who are members of your ethnicity? The
            definition will be stretched to enforce a monoculture that fits
            within the values of the CPC, and to aid the CPC in its cultural
            imperialism: note that people in Xinjiang are now considered
            "Chinese" (even though they maintain a token minority
            classification), and this Han Chauvinism is a key aspect of the
            CPC's imperialist efforts against Taiwan. I reject this attempt by
            the CPC to claim a mythological mantle of heaven that allows them to
            rule from the position of inheritor of all governments in the
            history of the region.

            I like writing, and I think everyone should write occasionally in a
            journal, or even just stream of consciousness. I'd like to write
            sci-fi novels eventually. I believe

            is very effective, and am running several experiments with pen and
            paper right now.

            Thus obviously I really like
            <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/tags/books/">reading</a>,
            particularly sci-fi novels.

            I like learning about older tools and technologies. That means I
            like being the Emacs guy at work. (Update: I switched to nvim.)
            (Update2: Now I use both lol.) I'm constantly trying to improve my
            vim skills. I like learning about various GNU command line tools,
            though I still have a lot to learn. I prefer building simple,
            accessible, static webpages whenever the opportunity arises. If I
            can get away with it, I like to write web applications in plain old
            Javascript without any frameworks, although this is rarely possible.
            If I can really get away with it, I like building websites without
            any Javascript at all, although this typically just leads to me
            building whatever site in some sort of server-side rendering type
            tool such as Hugo or Django.

            I like playing videogames, sometimes. Mostly lately I just like
            setting up streaming from my PC to my phone or Steam Deck, or
            building out a really cool emulation setup that I never use. I have
            a

            I really like riding motorcycles. I usually rent a motorcycle when I
            travel. So far I've ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam, around a bit
            in Japan, around a bit in the French and Italian Riviera, and around
            a whole lot of Taiwan. I have

            I like learning languages. I speak a bit of Japanese and a bit more
            Chinese. Fluency in Mandarin is a lifelong goal. At this point I'm
            pretty good.

            I love traveling. I can sometimes feel stuck somewhere, and life
            seems very, very short. Traveling alleviates those feelings. Plus, I
            love food, and traveling is a great way to eat.

            I'm idly into horology and am a slow-burning watch collector. I

            I enjoy modding watches. My projects so far have been a crystal swap
            on a seiko turtle, a bezel and caseback swap on a Vostok, a dial and
            handswap on a seiko skx007 that ended in disaster, and a failed
            attempt to repair a broken datewheel on a pagani.

            I like weightlifting, and believe it's crucial in keeping up my
