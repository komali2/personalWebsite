      <p>I have had a hobbyist interest in programming from a young age. I decided to make it my career
      and so attended Makersquare/Hackreactor, a programming bootcamp in San Francisco. There, I was trained 
      in web development, acquiring skills in Javascript (including ES6),  jQuery, Angular, Node, React, Backbone,
      Express, JS test suites, HTML, CSS, and deployment suites such as Heroku.</p>
      <p> Below are projects I worked on either with an agile team or solo. All are deployed, feel free to follow the links
        and try them out! Other than solo apps, I spend my time taking online MOOCs in AI and algorithms as well as 
        contributing to open-source repos. </p>

<div class="info gitnalysis" >
  <p>Gitnalysis is a Github analytics tool. It allows users to search for topics
  that interest them, be they technical or non-technical topics. Results 
  from searches are curated to allow users to find Github Users, Repos, and Organizations
  related to their chosen topic of interest. </p>

  <p>Clicking into a given repo will allow users to see issues, sorted by difficulty.
  We used the Google Predict API, an accessible Machine Learning API, to train
  a model what an "beginner," "intermediate," or "advanced" issue look like. We use React and Redux
  to control the view.</p>

<div class="info langbattle" >
  <p>Langbattle is a multiplayer flashcard app with multiple gamemodes. It allows users to 
    go head-to-head with eachother in the native and learning languages of their choice. Gamemodes include
    time trial as well as accuracy test. </p>

  <p>Langbattle uses Angular to manage eventing on the client-side, and Socket.io to communicate between
    users. It is deployed on Heroku and uses Heroku's Postgresql database built-in to store and access
    flashcards.</p>

<div class="info caffiend" >
  <p>Caffiend is a webapp that allows users to find their new favorite menu
    item at a given cafe. Users can search for cafes, view menus sorted by 
    item rating, and add their own cafes and menu items. </p>

  <p>Caffiend is built in Angular on the front end, with a Node and Express
    backend that communicates with an SQLite3 database. We designed custom stylesheets
    to allow finer control over the UX/UI than is possible with Bootstrap or Materialize.</p>
