            Reactwise is a software as a service (SaaS) company specializing in (bio)chemical
            process optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the first engineers and as the fullstack lead, later
            frontend lead, I designed and architected
            two early iterations of the frontend as well as the current prod build. We started
            in Nextjs with a Node backend and then moved to a React SPA with a FastAPI backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Features I developed include scientific plots using Plotly, such as a 3d surface
            plot and a complex interactive set of parameter interaction charts,
            a custom experimental design table using AG-grid, and full stack features in Python and FastAPI
              such as a chemical name to SMILES string to graphic molecular representation component.

            with a SaaS platform for procurement, purchase, and management of electronic components.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined to lead a rewrite of their frontend from a no-code platform to a
            React SPA backed by a Django backend. I hired and then led 2 other frontend engineers,
            set up project management in Linear, ticketed all UI features, established project
            timelines, managed bug reports and feature requests, and delegated tasks to the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also functioned as a full time IC, implementing fullstack features in React,
              Typescript, Python, and Django such as hardware component
            tables, extensively complicated dynamic forms for managing component prices in a shopping
            cart flow, authentication and token management, state management, API integrations, and
            build, deployment, and CI flows.

          <p>
              While there, I led the redesign and implementation of their landing page to feature
              their new Covid-19 vaccine services. I also retooled their email template system
              using MJML to allow branding in their automated emails for e.g. appointment reminders.
              As part of an accessibility initiative, I performed a VPAT audit and then project managed
              and functioned as IC in a full accessibility improvement sweep. Following the accessibility
              initiative, I functioned as a day to day IC implementing features such as a new appointment
              booking flow in React and Typescript.

          <p>
              Working on a small team mostly in Javascript, Backbone, and Marionette, I implemented
              features such as an entirely new IDE experience in Ace editor and a websocket notification

              such as rewriting the grunt/gulp bundling and CI system to use Webpack 4, and building
              a platform CMS in Vue.
