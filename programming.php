						<h2>Programming</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>My interest in programming stems from an early childhood nerdiness. I started out editing .dat
					files for my favorite videogames, moved on to building invisionfree boards in middle school, and then on to doing heinous
					things to my smartphones in highschool. In college, I took the field a bit more seriously, and have
					participated in several MOOCs and other online resources in order to self-educate. </p>
					<p>In the interest of self-promotion, I welcome you to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/komali2">my
					github profile</a> where I am currently featuring primarily my C code projects for the Hardvard CS50x MOOC
					on edx.org. In addition to C, I am comfortable in HTML, CSS, and PHP, and I further invite you to take a peek
					at the source of this website. I've also hosted on a frankenstein arch linux box running apache, although to avoid
					providing possible employers with broken links or inciting the wrath of my ISP, this website is
					hosted remotely. </p>

						You may find example pages below:<br>
						<ul>
							<li><a href='/javascriptExamples/calculateTriangle/measureTriange.html'>
								A perimeter measurer, using HTML forms and simple Javascript functions.</a>
						</ul>

					For those interested in following a self-learning path, please see below the resources I have found helpful
					beyond compare:</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/home">EDX.org</a>, a
							website with hundreds of MOOCs, almost entirely free.
							I recommend Harvard's CS50X, it is very accessible.</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, by far
							the most important tool in any programmer's toolbox. A Q/A format website
							with the least toxic community I have ever encountered on the internet.
							Make sure to check out the whole stackexchange ecosystem!</li>
							<li><a href="http://programmingbydoing.com/">ProgrammingByDoing</a>, developed
							by a Graham Mitchell, this website is great for not only learning
							the basics of Java, but the lessons themselves I have found applicable
							for many other languages.</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, another fantastic
							MOOC website.</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.khanacademy.com">Khan Academy</a>, primarily
							a math learning website, also contains various other subjects. As someone
							who's math education was somewhat lacking, I've found this website invaluable.</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.patrickjmt.com">Patrick JMT</a>, another math-learning website,
							also excellent.</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a>, a
							learner's subreddit. If you're anything like me you spend entirely too much
							time on reddit anyway, might as well subscribe to this one!</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208">
							Head First Java</a>, not free but a fantastic book for learning Java.</li>
