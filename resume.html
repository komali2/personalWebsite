              In preparation for the release and distribution of vaccines for Covid-19, Curative wanted
              to have a landing page specifically about this topic. Working with a designer, I implemented
              Curative's needs against a design while working in a feedback loop with the rest of the product
              team as well as Legal. I focused on implementing with native HTML as much as possible, making
              it much easier to make the page fully accessible.

              As part of a general branding movement for Curative, I was tasked with turning plaintext emails
              into more thoughtfully designed emails, with various images and information hierarchies. Having
              never worked with web development in an email context before I had no idea what a minefield it is,
              and had to learn everything from first principles while giving feedback to the design team on what
              is feasible. In any case, we got it done, and as of now all vaccine related emails are sporting
              the new format.

              I'm fortunate that leadership at Curative is very pro-accessibility, and so I spend the majority of
              my time now auditing, ticketing bugs towards, and then fixing, accessibility problems in various Curative
              websites and applications. Recently I'm proud to have converted Curative's custom, inacessible Checkbox

            Captec (registered as "Capital") is a New York based Fintech startup that helps companies determine
            their true net worth through unconventional, proprietary analysis. This leads to companies then
            being able to acquire non-dilutitative equity. From the website:
           "The Intelligent Credit Market looks at financial data from an unbiased vantage point.
            It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to surface pockets of profitability which if doubled down on can drive business success.
            The result is a blueprint for smart resource allocation accompanied by financing to power those plans."
            I worked for Captec for a short period of time at the behest of
            a friend in Taiwan, who asked for help on a specific project, detailed
            below.

              One of the quants at Captec had put together a whizz-bang of a React and Python app designed to
              intake a bunch of information about a company, including their balance sheets, and then in a
              web UI allow a user to underwrite said company, tweaking proprietary analysis algorithms with
              a goal of visualizing what various actions they can take would have on their bottom line. The application
              was standalone and Captec wanted to integrate it into their main web application. It was
              an extremely fascinating project in a field far outside my comfort zone (that is to say, finance)
              and I thoroughly enjoyed working in such an unfamiliar place. The primary technologies involved
              were Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Docker, Webpack, Node, and Python 3.

              nodes. The backend was a Node API managing a Datastore DB and user authentication through OAuth. I was
              the sole frontend engineer on this project.

              Unpublished, Soon to be Published Project - SQL Query Generator Game
            </h1>
            <p>
              This project was a game designed to teach users how to use the client's SQL
              Cloud database product, which as a result also made it a game to teach users
              how to craft SQL queries. One part was a WebGL / Canvas game map,
              designed in Tiled. The user could zoom in and out, scroll around, and select
              dynamically generated pins based on their progress in the game. The other part
              was a sort of two-pane text editor. One side would have a dropdown SQL generator,
              and the other the results of whatever query was on the left. The dropdown SQL
              generator turned the DOM into an
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> representation
              of a user-generated SQL query. We had to roll our own Javascript SQL tokenizer and
              parser. Furthermore, for security reasons, we had to parameterize all queries before
              sending them to the client's cloud database product. The frontend could craft queries using
              SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, DISTINCT, JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and GROUP BY,
              and was fully recursive (JOIN could be used practically infinitely, as could WHERE combined
              with AND / OR). The publishing has been delayed by COVID-19. Except for occasional involvement
              by my lead, I was the sole frontend engineer on this project.

              ImpCentral is the device management platform for Electric Imp Cloud and Electric Imp devices.
              Users can write, lint, and upload code to devices and servers. Users can also see the status
              of all of their devices, which could number in the hundreds of thousands. The frontend is
              a Backbone and Marionette app, using the Ace library as a web IDE, and Bootstrap as a CSS library.
              Originally, the app was bundled with Grunt, and there was no unit testing framework (although we had
              an incredible QA team). During my time, I upgraded the build system to use Webpack 3. Halfway through
              the upgrade, Webpack 4 was released, and so I redid the work to use Webpack 4, issuing several pull
              requests to major libraries (bootstrap, etc) to make them compatible with Webpack 4 so we could continue
              using them. I enabled hot-reloading for the team and took advantage of other Webpack features to reduce
              our bundle size and automate other parts of our workflow. I also integrated unit tests through Jest.
              The backend was various services in Node and Go, talking to various other services such as RabbitMQ.
              The application was mirrored across every major cloud provider, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure,
              as some clients wanted private clouds. Imp device VMs, and their paired servers, are programmed with Squirrel.
              Imp OS is written in C.

              As more clients contracted for Electric Imp's private cloud offering, we needed a way for them to manage
              common requests like user management or certain text changes without needing to file a support ticket
              with our relatively small engineering team. So, I was tasked with setting up a CMS that would deploy
              alongside all cloud instances. It was a Vue app that talked to a Node API.

            I live in Taipei, Taiwan. I'm open to local or remote roles. I don't
            intend to move back to the USA any time in the next 3 years. I have an
            unrestricted Gold Card work visa that allows me to work for Taiwanese or
            foreign companies with, well, no restrictions.
          </p>

            In my journey to discover the trailhead to my path as a Software Engineer,
            I've worked as an English teacher in China, Japan, and Taiwan. I've also
            worked as a recruiter in Taiwan and the USA. This have given me a unique
            advantage when mentoring budding engineers. If this describes you (or doesn't!),
            please feel free to contact me!

            I need to always be learning new things in order to feel happy. Right now,
            I'm working on achieving Mandarin fluency, learning Machine Learning,
            bolstering my backend skills in
            Javascript and Python, learning native programming on microcontrollers as well
            as on iOS and Android, undergoing a Bachelor's in Computer Science curriculum
            through online courses, studying philosophy of mind, and trying (poorly)
            to produce music in Ableton.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include motorcycling, baking, cooking, hiking, camping, weightlifting,
            reading, writing, photography, music production, and traveling.
            I blog about some of this, feel free to read
            at <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com">blog.calebjay.com</a>.
