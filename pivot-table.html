            <p>
                Pivot Table is an opportunity for me to explore displaying primarily
                tabular data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The data is a JSON blob
                of IP addresses listing bytes of traffic to and from a given address.
            </p>
            <p>
                Primary functionality is the ability to click an IP address to create a "pivot"
                showing all traffic to, or from, that address. I implemented this by hand, however
                the library I chose can also do more robust multi-select pivots using the dropdown
                menus. I was also able to plugin another library allowing for more than just tables,
                with options ranging from heatmaps to graphs and other charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose React as a framework to allow for a quick spin-up with Create React App, and
                also to have an opportunity to rekindle my React knowledge. I chose AWS to deploy on
                because it is straightforward and easy, and has well documented methods for load balancing,
                not that this simple app would ever require such things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Routing is done by hand - using
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams/get#Example">URLSearchParams.get</a>
                combined with the browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History API</a>
                and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onpopstate">window.onpopstate</a>.
                This is actually the portion of the app I learned the most from while developing - before, I had always just used
                built-in routers such as React Router, Angular Router, or Vue Router without thinking twice. Unfortunately, my API
                decisions here means these features likely won't work on IE11.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did not integrate any sort of CSS library such as bootstrap or materialize, because it
                is unnecessary for the complexity of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Event handling and etc is done in vanilla JavaScript, because it's fun to keep it simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I continue to work on the app in the future, my todo list will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Allow the app to work with more than the hardcoded JSON I provided
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore backend options for other data (databases, making calls to APIs)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement click-to-pivot functionality in more than just the "table" renderer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some styling improvements, looking at how to make the UX clearer and perhaps more beautiful
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More robust routing that includes history saved when different renderers (other than table)
                        are selected from the drop-down, as well as when options are selected from the built-in dropdown
                        filters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unit tests.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
