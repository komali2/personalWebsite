                Dog adoption is a straightforward playground that allows me to
                explore basic web-development paradigms, such as SEO and the
                differences when implementing something in, for example, 
                flexbox vs grid. The images and some boilerplate was helpfully
                provided by Asana.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial iteration is a dead-simple implementation of a list
                of images in JavaScript. I specifically avoided HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript APIs with lower adoption rates - the site should work
                <em>relatively</em> well in IE11, and perfectly well in anything
                newer than IE11. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As this was an opportunity as well to explore SEO, I researched
                some of the newer concepts of it and implemented with them in 
                mind. These include: ensuring the content of the website matches
                the meta keywords, ensuring the title is descriptive and matches
                the meta description, including a descriptive (descriptive is 
                a common requirement for Google in 2018!) h3 tag somewhere in 
                the body, adopting accessibility principles such as giving
                all images alt tags, and being mobile-responsive (more on that 
                later).
            </p>
            <p>
                Mobile responsiveness wasn't too difficult for such a simple
                app. A meta tag setting viewport ensured that pixel performance
                was the same across all devices (without this, small devices 
                with high resolutions would show everything exactly as you'd see
                it on a desktop screen, only tiny). Initially, I went with 
                Flexbox for it having <em>slightly</em> higher browser adoption,
                and also because it was truly responsive - the number of columns
                was totally depdent on, pixel-to-pixel, the width of the screen.
                However, this left big vertical gaps between elements, and 
                caused the final element to be center-aligned alone on its own
                row. So, I swapped over to css grid, which forced me to use 
                granular media queries to dynamically set column numbers, but
                does look so much better. (initial flexbox styling is visible
                on the initial-approach branch)
            </p>
            <p>
                Scalability is a question - right now, the app makes an internal
                request for a JSON of dog information. What if an external API 
                was to be queried? What if that API returned information on 
                2000 dogs? Well, I went ahead and tested exactly that scenario
                by blowing up the dogs array with 3,000 items, and noticed 
                near-instantaneous load. Possibly this is due to browser 
                efficiencies around not re-requesting images that already 
                downloaded (I just duplicated the list many times over). In any 
                case, a big win would be to implement pagination -
                something that could potentially be implemented client-side. It
                would probably work something like: determine vaguely how many
                images could fit in viewport, invoke the buildUl function on a 
                slice that big, if scroll down, invoke buildUl function on 
                another slice (ensuring not to include previously-chosen items)
                of size related to whatever the available size is now. Because
                the img elements are being added dynamically, their src 
                attribute should only cause a network request on being added 
                to the dom, making this a rare case where client-side pagination
                doesn't require a full download of data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Future work on the app:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implement client-side pagination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore build tooling, especially Webpack with Babel (
                        so as to allow ES6). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore unit testing (possibly overkill for such a 
                        simple project).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Install a linter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore pulling in a UI framework (such as Materialize
                        or Bootstrap) (probably unecessary)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore pulling in a JavaScript framework (such as
                        React or Vue) (probably unecessary)
                    </li>
                </ul>
