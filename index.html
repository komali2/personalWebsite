        <p>I'm Caleb. I have a B.A. in Creative Writing and work as a Software Engineer in San Francisco. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests include writing and programming. I intend to make a career
          out of the latter and dream to make a mildly lucrative hobby out of the former.
          If you are interested in seeing some of my work, check out my <a href='http://www.github.com/komali2'>github</a>

          I live for travel. I am lucky enough to have experienced a variety of cultures in my travels,
          and am proud that my efforts have landed me an intermediate Chinese language ability and a moderate
          Japanese language ability. I have written about many of my trips at
          <a href = 'http://www.ablate.blogspot.com'>ablate.blogspot.com.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          In the interest of self-improvement, I welcome all feedback to my work.
          I am always interested in opportunities to collaborate, be it in writing, filming,
          or programming. 
          If you have any questions, comments, or lucrative business proposals, please feel free to leave a comment
          on one of my blogs, message me on linkedin, or send me an email at rogersjcaleb@gmail.com.
