          This is a Now page. It's where people put what they've been up to the
          last year. A now page is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          an overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you
          hadn’t seen in a year
        </blockquote>
        -- <a href="https://sive.rs/now2"> Derek Sivers</a>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I live in Taiwan,
          <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/posts/why-taiwan/"
            >because I believe it's the best place to live on Earth for most
            people.</a
          >
          Things I like to do here include going to
          <a href="https://g0v.tw/intl/en/">g0v</a> hackathons, taking
          <a href="https://calebjay.com/photos">pictures</a>,

        <p>
          I've recently left my position as a frontend engineer at Reactwise,
          and this year my focus is on growing my contracting and consultancy
          firm <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>, as well as finding a way
          to generate revenue outside of selling my labor. I also hope to make
          many FOSS contributions this year.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
          I'm engaged to be married, in October. My parents left Taiwan in
          November and are planning on returning as soon as they can. I have
          several fish tanks, mostly filled with shrimp.
        </p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          I've just finished working as a software engineer at the YC startup
          <a href="https://reactwise.com">Reactwise</a>. We had to part ways
          after a grant required all employees to be UK resident, and I didn't
          want to move there. For the next month, I'm taking a break, focusing
          on Mandarin and finally picking up some of the programming languages
          I've wanted to for years. I'm growing a software engineering
          contracting and consultancy firm called
          <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>. We're always open to new
          members joining, and also have plenty of time available across our
          engineers for more contracting work. I'm also hosting coworking events
          and hackathons, as well as trying out some content creation, with
          subjects such as ambient coworking videos, and life in Taiwan.
        </p>
        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>In the last year, I've had the following trips:</p>
        <ul>

            A trip to Japan for Colive Fukuoka, followed up by Japan Burn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another trip to the UK to hang with Reactwise, with a wedding in
            London followed with a train ride across Europe, stopping for
            several nights in Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, then Copenhagen,
            then popping over to Lundt in Sweden to visit some friends.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          Since I have ADHD, I will always have too many hobbies I'm persuing at
          once, and the hobbies will always change. Right now:

        <h2>Philosophy, Ethics, Politics</h2>
        <p>
          I'm definitely even more obnoxiously leftist than the last time you
          talked to me.
