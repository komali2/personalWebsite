          <p>
            Reactwise is a software as a service (SaaS) company specializing in (bio)chemical
            process optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the first engineers and as the fullstack lead, later
            frontend lead, I designed and architected
            two early iterations of the frontend as well as the current prod build. We started
            in Nextjs with a Node backend and then moved to a React SPA with a FastAPI backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Features I developed include complex scientific plots using Plotly, such as a 3d surface
            plot and a complex interactive set of parameter interaction charts,
            a custom experimental design table using AG-grid, and a chemical name to SMILES string to
            graphic molecular representation component.

              An American streaming startup still in stealth requisitioned me to
              build a team to design and develop a desktop web streaming platform
              that integrated with their mobile streaming app's backend.

              I led most of the architectural decisions, taking input on the

            </p>
            <p>
              We built this just after the release of the new NextJS "app router"
              paradigm, necessitating forking and getting commits on the Apollo
              GraphQL Typescript library to ensure it worked with some of the
              new concepts in the latest version of NextJS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app allows users to login and host streaming sessions with chat,
              interactive games with viewers, and streaming statistics.

              Jovono is a principled investment firm with a portfolio that includes Hacker Noon, DoNotPay, and Paragon. I worked with them on updates and maintenance of their server side rendered React app, with data fetched from an Airtable API. I also migrated them to a Heroku deployment strategy, ensuring their SSL certificates continued to auto-renew under the new deployment strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              On another project, I led a junior in migrating Jovono's site from hosting on Heroku to Cloudflare Pages, a relatively new cloud offering that required upgrading Next.js up several major versions, and switching to a server-side generated paradigm. I also migrated the CMS from Airtable to Back4App, saving money and allowing for more flexible deployment strategies.

              In preparation for the release and distribution of vaccines for Covid-19, Curative wanted

              team as well as Legal. I focused on implementing with native HTML as much as possible, making
              it much easier to make the page fully accessible. Unfortunately, this page no longer exists, as
              Curative stopped offering vaccines.

              never worked with web development in an email context before I had no idea what a minefield it is,

              is feasible. In any case, we got it done, and as of now most Curative emails are sporting
              the new format.

            g0v is a non-profit hacker collective with no formal hierarchy or organization. It's a large collection of people mostly based in Taiwan that seek to mostly improve Taiwan in some way, though most of the projects, including the collective itself, are designed to be reproducible in other countries. One could call g0v a "civic tech" collective.

              disfactory (uncapitalized) is a civic tech project built in collaboration with a Taiwanese environmentalist NGO. The goal is to reduce the number of illegal factories in Taiwan. There is a crowd-sourcing app that allows users to report illegal factories, as well as view the status of that factory, anonymously. There is a backend that converts reports into properly formatted forms that are physically printed and sent to the relevant government authority. The NGO then assists by staying in touch with the local government to ensure action is actually taken on the illegal factory.

              twa11y, or, Taiwan Accessibility (or, Taiwan Ally), is a civic tech project with the objective of improving web accessibility on public good websites. I founded the project because of frustration with poor accessibility standards in places such as Taiwan hospital websites. Currently, it's mostly a project management effort. We have users submit bugs they find through either a Google Docs or directly as a Github Issue. We then organize these issues, and coordinate reaching out to representatives of a given website. The objective is to pitch an organization to let us fix said issues for free, with the side goal of this allowing me to get new engineers some real-world engineering experience and more projectwork on their portfolio, all while doing some civic good.

            Captec (registered as "Capital") is a New York based Fintech startup that helps companies determine
            their true net worth through unconventional, proprietary analysis. This leads to companies then
            being able to acquire equity. From the website:
           "The Intelligent Credit Market looks at financial data from an unbiased vantage point.
            It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to surface pockets of profitability which if doubled down on can drive business success.
            The result is a blueprint for smart resource allocation accompanied by financing to power those plans."
            I worked for Captec for a short period of time at the behest of
            a friend in Taiwan, who asked for help on a specific project, detailed

              One of the quants at Captec had put together a whizz-bang of a React and Python app designed to
              intake a bunch of information about a company, including their balance sheets, and then in a
              web UI allow a user to underwrite said company, tweaking proprietary analysis algorithms with
              a goal of visualizing what various actions they can take would have on their bottom line. The application
              was standalone and Captec wanted to integrate it into their main web application. It was
              an extremely fascinating project in a field far outside my comfort zone (that is to say, finance)
              and I thoroughly enjoyed working in such an unfamiliar place.

              Unpublished, Soon to be Published Project - SQL Query Generator Game

              This project was a game designed to teach users how to use the client's SQL
              Cloud database product, which as a result also made it a game to teach users
              how to craft SQL queries. One part was a WebGL / Canvas game map,
              designed in Tiled. The user could zoom in and out, scroll around, and select
              dynamically generated pins based on their progress in the game. The other part
              was a sort of two-pane text editor. One side would have a dropdown SQL generator,
              and the other the results of whatever query was on the left. The dropdown SQL
              generator turned the DOM into an
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> representation
              of a user-generated SQL query. We had to roll our own Javascript SQL tokenizer and
              parser. Furthermore, for security reasons, we had to parameterize all queries before
              sending them to the client's cloud database product. The frontend could craft queries using
              SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, DISTINCT, JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and GROUP BY,
              and was fully recursive (JOIN could be used practically infinitely, as could WHERE combined
              with AND / OR). The publishing has been delayed by COVID-19. Except for occasional involvement
              by my lead, I was the sole frontend engineer on this project.

              ImpCentral is the device management platform for Electric Imp Cloud and Electric Imp devices.
              Users can write, lint, and upload code to devices and servers. Users can also see the status
              of all of their devices, which could number in the hundreds of thousands. The frontend is
              a Backbone and Marionette app, using the Ace library as a web IDE, and Bootstrap as a CSS library.
              Originally, the app was bundled with Grunt, and there was no unit testing framework (although we had
              an incredible QA team). During my time, I upgraded the build system to use Webpack 3. Halfway through
              the upgrade, Webpack 4 was released, and so I redid the work to use Webpack 4, issuing several pull
              requests to major libraries (bootstrap, etc) to make them compatible with Webpack 4 so we could continue
              using them. I enabled hot-reloading for the team and took advantage of other Webpack features to reduce
              our bundle size and automate other parts of our workflow. I also integrated unit tests through Jest.
              The backend was various services in Node and Go, talking to various other services such as RabbitMQ.
              The application was mirrored across every major cloud provider, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure,
              as some clients wanted private clouds. Imp device VMs, and their paired servers, are programmed with Squirrel.
              Imp OS is written in C.

            AWS held a multi-category hackathon in San Francisco to evangelize some new cloud products
            they were launching. I led a team of engineers and designers to build an app that
            integrated several APIs of on-site sponsors and deploy on the new AWS cloud products.
            Our application was a reporting system for stranded dockless bicycles, built in
            Javascript / React, leveraging AWS Lambda, S3, and deployment via Amplify. Our app
            was selected by AWS as winners of the AWS portion of the hackathon, from among
            200 projects.

          <p>
            A hackathon was organized by multiple startups to advertise their API services. I led
            a team to strategically select from available sponsored APIs and create an integration
            that could lead to us winning multiple categories at once. We build a Python / Javascript
            application that leveraged the newly released Sensel hardware platform to create
            arbitrary-sequence programmable locks on a touchpad device. Sensel selected us as winner
            from about 100 other teams for their portion of the hackathon.

          <h2>Lecture on Web Portfolio Creation and Hosting</h2>
          <small>
            <h3>University of Houston, Texas, USA</h3>
            <time datetime="January, 2016">Jan, 2016</time>
          </small>
          <p>
            Gave a presentation to a conference of around thirty graduate students on a start to finish process for designing, engineering, deploying, and hosting a personal portfolio site. Created presentation materials and templates for students to use. Technologies involved were HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. Overall objective was to keep things as simple and easily maintainable as possible so students could indefinitely update their portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike typical tutorials on the subject, a good portion of the lecture focused on affordable, sustainable, and reliable deployment and hosting, so that participants could have their portfolio accessible on the web by the end of the lecture.

            I'm a USA citizen. I'm open to local or remote roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my journey to discover the trailhead to my path as a Software Engineer,
            I've worked as an English teacher in the PRC, Japan, and Taiwan. I've also
            worked as a recruiter in Taiwan and the USA. This have given me a unique
            advantage when mentoring budding engineers. If this describes you (or doesn't!),
            please feel free to contact me!
          </p>
          <p>
            I need to always be learning new things in order to feel happy. Right now,
            I'm working on achieving Mandarin fluency, learning Godot, grabbing a few new
            frontend libraries, deploying a ton of self hosted software, cranking microSaaS
            ideas, picking up mobile app development, and organizing hackathons.
          </p>
          <p>
            I frequently involve myself in activism and other activities, such as running and
            participating in several civic hack projects as well as previously working with
            a non profit in SF to teach kids to code for free. I also lead the Medical
            Team and Food Camp in Burning Man Taiwan, and am a Supervisor of Crossroads,
            an NGO in Taiwan helping revitalize rural areas as well as ensure the Taiwanese
            government treats people with accessibility needs fairly.
          </p>

            My hobbies include motorcycling, baking, cooking, hiking, camping, weightlifting,
            reading, writing, photography, music production, and traveling.
            I blog about some of this, feel free to read
