            My name is Caleb Jay Rogers. I live in Taipei,
            Taiwan. I'm a software engineer with a skillset primarily in
            web development, detailed below. I have a degree in Creative
            Writing from the University of Houston and seven years of
            professional software engineering experience.
            Right now I'm growing a software engineering contracting and consultancy firm called <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>,
            doing various volunteer engineering work in Taiwan, operating a <a href="https://thejispot.com">southern fried chicken biscuit restaurant</a> and
            studying Mandarin. While we're managing several projects at 508.dev right now, we have room to grow, and so,
            I'm actively interested in engineering and project management work, particularly that which would let me leverage the team I've
            been building.
            Also, I'm happy to pass along roles to my network.
            The best way to reach me is by email, and my address is
            caleb at calebjay dot com. For 508 related inquiries, that would be caleb at 508.dev.

            Skills
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm comfortable in all aspects of modern frontend
            engineering. I'm
            professionally experienced in the Javascript frameworks React,
            Vue.js,
            Backbone.js, and Angular, as well as the Python
            framework Django. I'm confident that I can adapt quickly to
            whatever web framework is thrown at me. I'm also experienced
            in the CSS frameworks Bootstrap 3 and 4, Materialize, and Google
            Material Design Components for Web (MDC). For proof, please
            follow links on my main page to some of my projects, see my
            Github, or send me an email with more specific questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also comfortable in integrations work between software such as Shopify, Wordpress, Medusa.js, Contentful, and various
            e-commerce, CMS, CRM, and ERP solutions. We've deployed and are actively managing several such solutions at 508.dev.
          </p>
          <p>
            When building web apps, I prefer Vue.js as a framework, Webpack as a
            build tool, and deployment via Google App Engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I can and have engineered with the following tools,
            technologies, and standards:

          <h1>Professional History</h1>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm scaling up my software engineering co-op <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>. We've
            had several successful projects and so I'm looking to develop the business further. Past projects have included a SASS product for Cofactr, mentioned below,
            as well as projects for an angel investor, a web development e-learning platform, a gender and queer issues e-learning and e-commerce platform, and a
            web streaming platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I hired and led the <a href="https://www.cofactr.com/">Cofactr</a> frontend development
            team and architected, managed, and built their SaaS frontend, from scratch. Cofactr is a ycombinator company with a hardware parts searching
            product, and while working with a backend engineer to design the server API, I led the frontend build. This included hiring and managing engineers,
            creating and assigning tickets, final responsibility for code review, and personally building out a large majority of the app. We built the SaaS as an SPA
            communicating with a Django server, in Typescript, React, Redux / Redux Toolkit, MUI, and Webpack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously most of my time was devoted to <a href="https://curative.com/">Curative</a>, a medical testing company has delivered over one million Covid-19 vaccines.
            At Curative, I was focused
            on making their applications accessible, while developing primarily with technologies such
            as Javascript, Typescript, React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Webpack, and Python 3. In particular, I engineered
            Curative's Vaccine Landing Page (now defunct as Curative no longer offers vaccines), rebranded
            almost all of their emails, and after performing a full multi-device accessibility audit, am
            in the process of getting their application entirely web accessible by meeting
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/">W3C Accessibility Standards</a>. I'm passionate
            about web accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            My previous full time position was at
            <a href="http://p.ota.to"> Potato.</a> Potato is a design and
            engineering firm based in London and San Francisco.
            I worked on projects for clients such as Google using technologies like
            Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Webpack, Vue.js, Canvas / WebGL,
            Python, Django, and other modern web development tools. As of writing, unfortunately the
            only project that's live is <a href="https://careers.google.com">Google Careers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Potato, I was working as a frontend engineer at
            <a href="https://www.electricimp.com/">Electric Imp</a>,
            on their web-based IoT device management tool. We worked in
            Javascript, Backbone / Marionette, Vue, and LESS. The build was
            prepared by Grunt and Gulp, and there were no unit tests (though
            we had a crazy good QA team for integration testing). While I
            was there, I spun up a Vue.js app from scratch to act as an
            admin portal for private cloud customers, and then ported our
            main app to a Webpack build system, adding capability for unit
            tests as well as our first unit tests on the frontend.
            This also allowed us to use ES6 / ES2015.
            I did this amidst the release of Webpack 4, and thus ended up firing
            off a bunch of random pull requests for various JS libraries
            that I regret not keeping better track of so I could brag about
            it here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Electric Imp, I was at first a student, and then a
            teacher's assistant, at Makersquare (which became HackReactor,
            which was then bought by Galvanize). That was an exciting time.
            I have blogged about the experience in several posts:

            Before Hack Reactor, I was an Engineering and Design recruiter
            at NES Global Talent in Houston. I was exploring a life path I
            thought I would be good at: sales. Either it didn't work because
            of the oil price dropping from around 100$ a barrel to around
            $40 after my first week, or because it's just not the life for
            me. I'm glad, now, that it didn't work out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my job as a recruiter at Hack Reactor, I was an English
            as a second language teacher in Taiwan, teaching people from
            ages 5 to adults. I have also blogged extensively about this:

          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was a kind of product manager, web developer, general
            English-speaking-dude-to-drag-around-trade-shows at BIG
            Entertainment, a media distributor based out of Taipei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was head of the technical internship development
            program at AIESEC Taiwan.

            I've founded a general software engineering LLC, <a href="https://508.dev">508.dev</a>, and
            I'd like to develop this business further to enable my team to reach a level of income that lets
            us begin spending time developing our own products or platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to establish a very strong architectural ability in web development,
            from a systems design standpoint. I've worked on a lot of very well scaled
            systems over the years, using multiple cloud technologies and scaling strategies,
            however that was never my primary focus. I'd like to focus more specifically on
            those tools and strategies. This seems to be happening naturally as I transition
            to leading software teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm considering picking up some mobile app development skills. Right now
            I'm working on adding sync by Google Drive functionality to the Android
            app <a href="https://github.com/komali2/orgzly-android">Orgzly</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to learn a great deal about AI from a practical
            engineering standpoint as well as a scientific research standpoint.
            In striving for this very long-term goal, I'm filling the gaps of a
            spotty and weird education by studying a lot of math.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to learn a lot more "native" engineering,
            such as embedded systems. I'd like to learn
            Assembly for some instruction set, it doesn't quite matter which
            one.
          </p>

            I'm in the process of founding a chocolate factory in Taiwan that exclusively uses Taiwan cacao beans.

          <p>
            I'm 20% of the founding team of a <a href="https://thejispot.com/">Chicken Biscuit</a> restaurant in Taiwan.
            I really enjoy digitizing a lot of this business, including our point of sale, vendor management, stock management,
            and financial analysis.

            Information should be free and easily accessed. In fact, it should
            be actively given to people that could find it useful. So therefore,
            efforts to hide, obscure, or obfuscate information are bad. This
            means I support libraries and the taxes that pay for them, the free
            software movement and the organizations that support it such as GNU,
            whistle-blowers, journalists, grey-hat hackers, and bio-hackers. This
            means I don't support efforts to suppress the free flow of
            information, such as many aspect of international copyright law,
            big pharma lobbying in the US government, whistle-blower crackdowns,
            governments that restrict information and harm journalists such as
            the CCP, or highly expensive scientific publications.
            This means when I write code, I try to write <em>extensive</em>
            documentation as I do
            so, with the objective of my non-technical coworkers being able to
            read and understand what my code is doing.
            This means I prefer libre tools to do my work, such as Emacs and
            Linux.
            This means I love teaching.
            This means web accessibility should be first-class consideration
            when building a web application.
            This means that I welcome anybody and everybody to email me about
            anything they think I can help them with understanding better.
            Also, education should be free.

            Climate change is real and is the number one existential threat
            we face.
            This means I try to do my small part in avoiding
            climate-damaging activities.
            This means I prefer jobs in locations to which I can walk, bike or
            take public transit.
            This means I believe cars should be almost entirely banned inside
            most major cities (among many other reasons).
            This means I support public transit, bicycle lanes, and the taxes
            that support these things.
            This means I probably won't work for, or create applications for,
            climate-damaging corporations in industries such as Oil and Gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            People should be good to eachother and support eachother, and
            violence is almost never an acceptable solution to a problem.
            This means I support organizations such as the Peace Corps,
            Red Cross, CERT, and social welfare and the taxes that pay for it.
            This means that in general I won't do any work for any nation's
            military or military industrial complex, barring social welfare
            work.
            This means I believe all militaries worldwide should be almost
            completely defunded and disbanded, barring their humanitarian
            branches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self determination is good. Violation of sovereignty is generally
            bad. This means I support the sovereign nation of Taiwan and reject
            efforts of the PRC to bring democratic Taiwan under its imperialist
            rule. It also means I support a free Hong Kong. If you have fallen
            under the sway of CCP propaganda and believe Taiwan isn't a
            sovereign nation, email me and I'll help you understand why you're
            wrong.
            This means I believe various forms of democracy and rule of the
            people are the only valid forms of governance.
            This means I oppose efforts by the American Republican party to prevent Americans from voting.
            This means I oppose the Russian invasion of sovereign Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is short and should be enjoyed. This means I reject restrictive
            dogmas that demonize human tendencies. This means I celebrate
            good food, friendship, and happiness. This means I reject excessive
            materialism.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            Capitalism isn't working to serve the needs of humans anymore.
            We should eliminate artificial scarcity,
            and begin planning today for what we intend for
            humans to do when we no longer have to justify our existence
            through labor. I regularly ask politicians what their plan is for their community
            when the value of their constituents' labor is pennies per hour, and I've never gotten an answer.
            It seems nobody is planning for this inevitability.

            The anarchists probably have it right.

            I'm currently obsessed with self hosting, and have deployed a self hosted <a href="https://jellyfin.org/"> netflix alternative</a>, <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org/">Audible alternative,</a> <a href="https://komga.org/">comic book reader,</a> <a href="https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web">ebook reader and OPDS server,</a> <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Spotify alternative,</a> <a href="https://events.thestinkytofu.com/">events management platform,</a> <a href="https://dudle.thestinkytofu.com/cgi-bin/">public polling platform,</a> <a href="https://www.photoprism.app/">Google Photos alternative,</a> <a href="https://freshrss.thestinkytofu.com/">RSS reader,</a> <a href="https://leantime.io/">JIRA alternative</a>, <a href="https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater">business expense and invoice tracking software</a>, <a href="https://www.kimai.org/">time tracking software</a> and <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Google Drive</a> alternative. I have more things I want to deploy, and I get new ideas from the really cool Github repo <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self Hosted</a>. I learned a ton about unix and devops doing this, and is why I  <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/posts/new-project-vps-setup/"> deploy most personal projects now on a VPS</a>.

            I really love photography, and later I'll link to a public portfolio. Right now I crashed my photo server because I forgot to point the docker volume for the software's thumbnail gallery to my zfs pool (64 TB) instead of my root drive (512 GB) and I don't have time to fix it.

            I like writing, and I think everyone should write occasionally in a
            journal, or even just stream of consciousness. I'd like to write
            sci-fi novels eventually. I'm working on some now, but not with any
            discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus obviously I really like reading, particularly sci-fi novels.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like cooking and baking, and am really good at both.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like learning about older tools and technologies.
            That means I like
            being the Emacs guy at work. I'm constantly trying to improve my vim
            skills (I use evil-mode in Emacs). I like learning about various GNU
            command line tools, though I still have a lot to learn. I prefer
            building simple, accessible, static webpages whenever the
            opportunity arises. If I can get away with it, I like to write web
            applications in plain old Javascript without any frameworks,
            although this is rarely
            possible. If I can really get away with it, I like building websites
            without any Javascript at all, although this typically just leads to
            me building whatever site in some sort of server-side rendering type
            tool such as Hugo or Django.
          </p>

            I like playing videogames, sometimes. Mostly lately I just like setting up streaming from my PC to my phone or Steam Deck,
            or building out a really cool emulation setup that I never use.
            I have
            a <a href="http://blog.calebjay.com/tags/gaming/"> couple blog posts
            on the subject</a>.

            I'm starting to learn how to produce electronic music in Ableton. I
            enjoy it but am currently frustratingly bad at it. Here's my

            I really like riding motorcycles. I usually rent a motorcycle when
            I travel.
            So far I've ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam, around a bit in
            Japan, around a bit in the French and Italian Riviera, and around
            a whole lot of Taiwan. I have
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz49KNOFH8-lqwB-NBCHrUlYTyn6ij57Q">a lot of riding videos on youtube.</a>
            I also <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/tags/motorcycle/">blog about this.</a>

            I like learning languages. I speak a bit of Japanese and a bit more
            Chinese. Fluency in Mandarin is a 3 year goal for me. At this point I'm pretty good.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru3FRUSmRcY">Here's a video of me giving a presentation in Mandarin at a g0v hackathon.</a>

            I love traveling. I can sometimes feel stuck somewhere, and life
            seems very, very short. Traveling alleviates those
            feelings. Plus, I love food, and traveling is a great way to eat.

            I'm idly into horology and am a slow-burning watch collector.
            I <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/tags/watch/">blog about this, too.</a>
            I enjoy modding watches. My projects so far have been a
            crystal swap on a seiko turtle, a bezel and caseback swap on a Vostok,
            a dial and handswap on a seiko skx007 that ended in disaster, and a failed
            attempt to repair a broken datewheel on a pagani.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like meditating.

            I like weightlifting.
