          <p>
            I'm a software engineer with 8 years of experience.
            Since 2016 I've been building React, Vue, Node/JS/TS, and Python
            apps for companies such as Electric Imp, Potato, Google, Captec,
            Curative, and Cofactr. I've led engineering teams and functioned as
            a project manager. In 2021 I founded a software
            engineering co-op called <a href="https://508.dev">508.dev</a>, a
            design and development firm that's delivered successfully for
            several clients, including Y Combinator startups.

            Gave a presentation to a conference of around thirty graduate students on a start to finish process for designing, engineering, deploying, and hosting a personal portfolio site. Created presentation materials and templates for students to use. Technologies involved were HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. Overall objective was to keep things as simple and easily maintainable as possible so students could indefinitely update their portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike typical tutorials on the subject, a good portion of the lecture focused on affordable, sustainable, and reliable deployment and hosting, so that participants could have their portfolio accessible on the web by the end of the lecture.

                A hackathon was organized by multiple startups to advertise their API services. I led
                a team to strategically select from available sponsored APIs and create an integration
                that could lead to us winning multiple categories at once. We build a Python / Javascript
                application that leveraged the newly released Sensel hardware platform to create
                arbitrary-sequence programmable locks on a touchpad device. Sensel selected us as winner
                from about 100 other teams for their portion of the hackathon.

                AWS held a multi-category hackathon in San Francisco to evangelize some new cloud products
                they were launching. I led a team of engineers and designers to build an app that
                integrated several APIs of on-site sponsors and deploy on the new AWS cloud products.
                Our application was a reporting system for stranded dockless bicycles, built in
                Javascript / React, leveraging AWS Lambda, S3, and deployment via Amplify. Our app
                was selected by AWS as winners of the AWS portion of the hackathon, from among
                200 projects.

              Lead Software Engineer (Frontend), Architect, Project Manager
            </h2>
            <p>
              Cofactr is a <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/cofactr">Y Combinator</a> startup based out of Brooklyn, New York,
              with a platform for "procurement, purchase, and management of electronic components."
              Their platform was built on a no-code toolset, and the rapid addition of customers created an urgent need for a full rewrite.
              I was brought on to lead the frontend side of the rewrite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Functioning as architect and project manager for the frontend, I advised on framework and technology choices. I set up project management in Linear and ticketed all UI features based on designs provided by the CEO, while advising on the UX. I established the project timeline, estimated tickets, and when we were ready to build, put together a team of frontend engineers for which I managed tasks and HR ancillaries through 508.dev. I also integrated the Toptal engineer Cofactr added partway through the project. In all, I was project managing a team of four frontend engineers (including me) across four timezones. Throughout the project, I planned our sprints, ticketed new features, managed bug reports and QA from the executive team, reviewed and merged code from the frontend team, and worked with the API team on design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              While functioning as project manager, I also functioned as lead individual contributor and architect on the frontend, with occasional contributions on the backend API as well. I built a large bulk of the frontend app, creating components, patterns, authentication, token management, and request frameworks to be used by the rest of the frontend team while implementing features.
            </p>
            <p>
              The frontend app is a React SPA deployed statically to an Amazon S3 bucket. It communicates with a Django REST API. State management was initially done using Thunk style API requests feeding a Redux data store, but was later converted entirely to an RTK Query cache and state management pattern. MUI components were integrated to allow for rapid prototyping and UX iteration. Typescript allowed for easy mapping of the frontend objects against the API types. There are extensive form based UX flows for creating and editing resources, for which Formik and Yup were used to allow for good form error UX, validation, and state management. There are also a great many resource tables throughout the app, for which we used MUI DataGrid to render data, creating custom render cell components as needed. The app is built with Webpack. Eslint enforced a code standard that I chose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that the app is built, I'm working with Cofactr's new platform lead to transition further development of the app to a new internal staff team, while continuing to optimize and fix any bugs found as the new engineers established themselves.

                A private investor had alpha regarding automated cryptocurrency trading.
                I put together and led a team to build a product to capitalize on this alpha.

            <p>
              An American streaming startup still in stealth requisitioned me to
              build a team to design and develop a desktop web streaming platform
              that integrated with their mobile streaming app's backend.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led most of the architectural decisions, taking input on the
              client's specific technical requests such as building in NextJS.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built this just after the release of the new NextJS "app router"
              paradigm, necessitating forking and getting commits on the Apollo
              GraphQL Typescript library to ensure it worked with some of the
              new concepts in the latest version of NextJS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app allows users to login and host streaming sessions with chat,
              interactive games with viewers, and streaming statistics.

              Jovono is a principled investment firm with a portfolio that includes Hacker Noon, DoNotPay, and Paragon. I worked with them on updates and maintenance of their server side rendered React app, with data fetched from an Airtable API. I also migrated them to a Heroku deployment strategy, ensuring their SSL certificates continued to auto-renew under the new deployment strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              On another project, I led a junior in migrating Jovono's site from hosting on Heroku to Cloudflare Pages, a relatively new cloud offering that required upgrading Next.js up several major versions, and switching to a server-side generated paradigm. I also migrated the CMS from Airtable to Back4App, saving money and allowing for more flexible deployment strategies.

              In preparation for the release and distribution of vaccines for Covid-19, Curative wanted
              to have a landing page specifically about this topic. Working with a designer, I implemented
              Curative's needs against a design while working in a feedback loop with the rest of the product
              team as well as Legal. I focused on implementing with native HTML as much as possible, making
              it much easier to make the page fully accessible. Unfortunately, this page no longer exists, as
              Curative stopped offering vaccines.

              As part of a general branding movement for Curative, I was tasked with turning plaintext emails
              into more thoughtfully designed emails, with various images and information hierarchies. Having
              never worked with web development in an email context before I had no idea what a minefield it is,
              and had to learn everything from first principles while giving feedback to the design team on what
              is feasible. In any case, we got it done, and as of now most Curative emails are sporting
              the new format.

              I'm fortunate that leadership at Curative is very pro-accessibility, and so I spend the majority of

              components into accessible ones. See the before: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhMb38WG0k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhMb38WG0k</a> and after:

              disfactory (uncapitalized) is a civic tech project built in collaboration with a Taiwanese environmentalist NGO. The goal is to reduce the number of illegal factories in Taiwan. There is a crowd-sourcing app that allows users to report illegal factories, as well as view the status of that factory, anonymously. There is a backend that converts reports into properly formatted forms that are physically printed and sent to the relevant government authority. The NGO then assists by staying in touch with the local government to ensure action is actually taken on the illegal factory.

              twa11y, or, Taiwan Accessibility (or, Taiwan Ally), is a civic tech project with the objective of improving web accessibility on public good websites. I founded the project because of frustration with poor accessibility standards in places such as Taiwan hospital websites. Currently, it's mostly a project management effort. We have users submit bugs they find through either a Google Docs or directly as a Github Issue. We then organize these issues, and coordinate reaching out to representatives of a given website. The objective is to pitch an organization to let us fix said issues for free, with the side goal of this allowing me to get new engineers some real-world engineering experience and more projectwork on their portfolio, all while doing some civic good.

              One of the quants at Captec had put together a whizz-bang of a React and Python app designed to
              intake a bunch of information about a company, including their balance sheets, and then in a
              web UI allow a user to underwrite said company, tweaking proprietary analysis algorithms with
              a goal of visualizing what various actions they can take would have on their bottom line. The application
              was standalone and Captec wanted to integrate it into their main web application. It was
              an extremely fascinating project in a field far outside my comfort zone (that is to say, finance)

            <p>
              This project was a front and backend app designed to allow sales people to generate and share value
              maps. The user would be taken through steps involved making the map, including creating nodes against
              pre-defined columns, connecting said nodes, and then generating sales pitch tracks based off connected
              nodes. The backend was a Node API managing a Datastore DB and user authentication through OAuth. I was
              the sole frontend engineer on this project.

              Unpublished, Soon to be Published Project - SQL Query Generator Game
            </h1>
            <p>
              This project was a game designed to teach users how to use the client's SQL
              Cloud database product, which as a result also made it a game to teach users
              how to craft SQL queries. One part was a WebGL / Canvas game map,
              designed in Tiled. The user could zoom in and out, scroll around, and select
              dynamically generated pins based on their progress in the game. The other part
              was a sort of two-pane text editor. One side would have a dropdown SQL generator,
              and the other the results of whatever query was on the left. The dropdown SQL
              generator turned the DOM into an
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> representation
              of a user-generated SQL query. We had to roll our own Javascript SQL tokenizer and
              parser. Furthermore, for security reasons, we had to parameterize all queries before
              sending them to the client's cloud database product. The frontend could craft queries using
              SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, DISTINCT, JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and GROUP BY,
              and was fully recursive (JOIN could be used practically infinitely, as could WHERE combined
              with AND / OR). The publishing has been delayed by COVID-19. Except for occasional involvement
              by my lead, I was the sole frontend engineer on this project.

              ImpCentral is the device management platform for Electric Imp Cloud and Electric Imp devices.
              Users can write, lint, and upload code to devices and servers. Users can also see the status
              of all of their devices, which could number in the hundreds of thousands. The frontend is
              a Backbone and Marionette app, using the Ace library as a web IDE, and Bootstrap as a CSS library.
              Originally, the app was bundled with Grunt, and there was no unit testing framework (although we had
              an incredible QA team). During my time, I upgraded the build system to use Webpack 3. Halfway through
              the upgrade, Webpack 4 was released, and so I redid the work to use Webpack 4, issuing several pull
              requests to major libraries (bootstrap, etc) to make them compatible with Webpack 4 so we could continue
              using them. I enabled hot-reloading for the team and took advantage of other Webpack features to reduce
              our bundle size and automate other parts of our workflow. I also integrated unit tests through Jest.
              The backend was various services in Node and Go, talking to various other services such as RabbitMQ.
              The application was mirrored across every major cloud provider, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure,
              as some clients wanted private clouds. Imp device VMs, and their paired servers, are programmed with Squirrel.
              Imp OS is written in C.

              As more clients contracted for Electric Imp's private cloud offering, we needed a way for them to manage
              common requests like user management or certain text changes without needing to file a support ticket
              with our relatively small engineering team. So, I was tasked with setting up a CMS that would deploy
              alongside all cloud instances. It was a Vue app that talked to a Node API.
