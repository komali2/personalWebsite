              This is a Now page. It's where people put what they've been up to the last year. A now page is:
              <blockquote>
                  an overview of what’s going on with you — what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year
              </blockquote>
              -- <a href="https://sive.rs/now2"> Derek Sivers</a>
          </p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
              I live in Taiwan, <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/posts/why-taiwan/">because I believe it's
              the best place to live on Earth for most people.</a>
              Things I like to do here include going to <a href="https://g0v.tw/intl/en/">g0v</a> hackathons,
              taking <a href="https://calebjay.com/photos">pictures</a>,
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR2K9vyQEBb4qUyunijtBHg">riding motorcycles</a> in
              the mountains, <a href="https://freesound.org/people/calebjay/">recording ambient sounds</a>,
              contributing to open source streetviews with Mapillary, riding ubikes on the riverside,
              coworking at cafes with people, and many other things.
          </p>
          <h2>Family</h2>
          <p>
              I'm engaged to be married, and my parents recently moved to Taiwan. Wedding most likely late 2026.
              I have several fish tanks, mostly filled with shrimp. 
          </p>
          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
            Right now I'm working as a software engineer at the YC startup <a href="https://reactwise.com">Reactwise</a>, 
            and growing a software engineering contracting and consultancy firm called <a href="https://508.dev/">508.dev</a>.
            work. We're always open to new members joining, and also have plenty of time available across
            our engineers for more contracting work.
          </p>
          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>
              In the last year, I've had the following trips:
              <ul>
                  <li>
                     Right now I'm on a trip to Japan for Colive Fukuoka, followed up by Japan Burn. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Another trip to the UK to hang with Reactwise, with a wedding in London followed with a train ride across Europe, stopping for several 
                     nights in Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, then Copenhagen, then popping over to Lundt in Sweden to visit some friends.
                  </li>

              </ul>

        </p>
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
              Since I have ADHD, I will always have too many hobbies I'm persuing at once, and the hobbies
              will always change. Right now:

          <h2>Philosophy, Ethics, Politics</h2>
          <p>
              I'm definitely even more obnoxiously leftist than the last time you talked to me.
          </p>
