            My name is Caleb Jay Rogers. I live in Taipei,
            Taiwan. I'm a software engineer with a skillset primarily in
            web development, detailed below. I have a degree in Creative
            Writing from the University of Houston and four years of
            professional software engineering experience.
            Right now I'm picking up part time contracts while studying Mandarin,
            upskilling various aspects of my engineering abilities (embedded systems,
            big data, AI), and persuing personal projects. I'm not actively
            looking for new contracts or a new full time position, but I
            will entertain opportunities that I come across, particularly
            if they are in a space that lets me persue my interests (AI,
            education, open source, humanitarianism).
            Also, I'm happy to pass along roles to my network.
            The best way to reach me is by email, and my address is
            caleb at calebjay (this website).

            Skills
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm extremely comfortable in all aspects of modern frontend
            engineering, including Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I'm
            professionally experienced in the Javascript frameworks React,
            Vue.js,
            Backbone.js, and Angular, as well as the Python
            framework Django. I'm confident that I can adapt quickly to
            whatever web framework is thrown at me. I'm also experienced
            in the CSS frameworks Bootstrap 3 and 4, Materialize, and Google
            Material Desigh Components for Web (MDC). For proof, please
            follow links on my main page to some of my projects, see my
            Github, or send me an email with more specific questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When building web apps, I prefer Vue.js as a framework, Webpack as a
            build tool, and deployment via Google App Engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I can engineer with the following tools,
            technologies, and standards with little to no assistance:
            <ul>
              <li>
                HTML
              </li>
              <li>
                Web Accessibility (WCAG, 508)
              </li>
              <li>
                Javascript, ES5, ES6, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Vue
              </li>
              <li>
                Webpack
              </li>
              <li>
                Python (2, 3)(I prefer 3)
              </li>
              <li>
                Backbone
              </li>
              <li>
                jQuery
              </li>
              <li>
                React
              </li>
              <li>
                CSS
              </li>
              <li>
                SASS
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Angular
              </li>
              <li>
                Canvas and Canvas tools (Pixi.js, Fabric.js)
              </li>
              <li>
                WebGL (see Canvas)
              </li>
              <li>
                Querying and Deploying SQL databases (but not with the skills
                of a good DBA or Devops team)
              </li>
              <li>
                Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
              </li>
              <li>
                AWS Cloud Platform (Lambda, S3)
              </li>
              <li>
                Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Jest, Karma
              </li>
              <li>
                git, Github, Gitlab
              </li>
            </ul>
            Also, here's some technologies I know a bit about, and could probably
            figure out with some ramp up time:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Go / Golang
              </li>
              <li>
                Lisp
              </li>
              <li>
                Bash
              </li>
              <li>
                C
              </li>
              <li>
                Game Development
              </li>

            Currently most of my billed time is devoted to <a href="https://curative.com/">Curative</a>.
            Curative is a medical testing and vaccine distribution company that pivoted quickly during
            the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing it to deliver, to date, over one million Covid-19 vaccines,
            while processing millions of Covid-19 tests every week. With Curative, I've been focused
            on making their applications accessible, while developing primarily with technologies such
            as Javascript, HTML, CSS (styled components), Webpack, and Python 3. In particular, I engineered
            Curative's <a href="https://curative.com/covid-19-vaccine">Covid-19 landing page</a>, rebranded
            their vaccine-related emails, and after performing a full multi-device accessibilty audit, am
            in the process of getting their application entirely web accessible, that is to say, by meeting
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/">W3C Accessibility Standards</a>. I'm passionate
            about Web accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            My previous full time position was at
            <a href="http://p.ota.to"> Potato.</a> Potato is a design and
            engineering firm based in London and San Francisco.
            I worked on projects for clients such as Google using technologies like
            Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Webpack, Vue.js, Canvas / WebGL,
            Python, Django, and other modern web development tools. As of writing, unfortunately the
            only project that's live is <a href="https://careers.google.com">Google Careers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Potato, I was working as a frontend engineer at
            <a href="https://www.electricimp.com/">Electric Imp</a>,
            on their web-based IoT device management tool. We worked in
            Javascript ES5, Backbone / Marionette, and CSS. The build was
            prepared by Grunt and Gulp, and there were no unit tests (though
            we had a crazy good QA team for integration testing). While I
            was there, I spun up a Vue.js app from scratch to act as an
            admin portal for private cloud customers, and then ported our
            main app to a Webpack build system, adding capability for unit
            tests as well as our first unit tests on the frontend.
            This also allowed us to use ES6 / ES2015.
            I did this amidst the release of Webpack 4, and thus ended up firing
            off a bunch of random pull requests for various JS libraries
            that I regret not keeping better track of so I could brag about
            it here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Electric Imp, I was at first a student, and then a
            teacher's assistant, at Makersquare (which became HackReactor,
            which was then bought by Galvanize). That was an exciting time.
            I have blogged about the experience in several posts:

            Before Hack Reactor, I was an Engineering and Design recruiter
            at NES Global Talent in Houston. I was exploring a life path I
            thought I would be good at: sales. Either it didn't work because
            of the oil price dropping from around 100$ a barrel to around
            $40 after my first week, or because it's just not the life for
            me. I'm glad, now, that it didn't work out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my job as a recruiter at Hack Reactor, I was an English
            as a second language teacher in Taiwan, teaching people from
            ages 5 to adults. I have also blogged extensively about this:

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was a kind of product manager, web developer, general
            English-speaking-dude-to-drag-around-trade-shows at BIG
            Entertainment, a media distributor based out of Taipei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was head of the technical internship development
            program at AIESEC Taiwan.

            I'd like to establish a very strong architectural ability in web development,
            from a systems design standpoint. I've worked on a lot of very well scaled
            systems over the years, using multiple cloud technologies and scaling strategies,
            however that was never my primary focus. I'd like to focus more specifically on
            those tools and strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm considering picking up some mobile app development skills. Right now
            I'm working on adding sync by Google Drive functionality to the Android
            app <a href="https://github.com/komali2/orgzly-android">Orgzly</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to learn a great deal about AI from a practical
            engineering standpoint as well as a scientific research standpoint.
            In striving for this very long-term goal, I'm filling the gaps of a
            spotty and weird education by studying a lot of math.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to learn a lot more "native" engineering,
            such as embedded systems. I'd like to learn
            Assembly for some instruction set, it doesn't quite matter which
            one.

            All people are equal.
            Systemic racism is real, and harmful.

            Information should be free and easily accessed. In fact, it should
            be actively given to people that could find it useful. So therefore,
            efforts to hide, obscure, or obfuscate information are bad. This
            means I support libraries and the taxes that pay for them, the free
            software movement and the organizations that support it such as GNU,
            whistleblowers, journalists, grey-hat hackers, and bio-hackers. This
            means I don't support efforts to suppress the free flow of
            information, such as many aspect of international copyright law,
            big pharma lobbying in the US government, whistleblower crackdowns,
            governments that restrict information and harm journalists such as
            the CCP, or highly expensive scientific publications.
            This means when I write code, I try to write <em>extensive</em>
            documentation as I do
            so, with the objective of my non-technical coworkers being able to
            read and understand what my code is doing.
            This means I prefer libre tools to do my work, such as Emacs and
            Linux.
            This means I love teaching.
            This means web accessibility should be first-class consideration
            when building a web application.
            This means that I welcome anybody and everybody to email me about
            anything they think I can help them with understanding better.
            Also, education should be free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Climate change is real and is the number one existential threat
            we face.
            This means I try to do my small part in avoiding
            climate-damaging activities.
            This means I prefer jobs in locations to which I can walk, bike or
            take public transit.
            This means I believe cars should be almost entirely banned inside
            most major cities (among many other reasons).
            This means I support public transit, bicycle lanes, and the taxes
            that support these things.
            This means I probably won't work for, or create applications for,
            climage-damaging corporations in industries such as Oil and Gas.
          </p>

            People should be good to eachother and support eachother, and
            violence is almost never an acceptable solution to a problem.
            This means I support organizations such as the Peace Corps,
            Red Cross, CERT, and social welfare and the taxes that pay for it.
            This means that in general I won't do any work for any nation's
            military or military industrial complex, barring social welfare
            work.
            This means I believe all militaries worldwide should be almost
            completely defunded and disbanded, barring their humanitarian
            branches.

            Self determination is good. Violation of sovereignty is generally
            bad. This means I support the sovereign nation of Taiwan and reject
            efforts of the PRC to bring democratic Taiwan under its imperialist
            rule. It also means I support a free Hong Kong. If you have fallen
            under the sway of CCP propaganda and believe Taiwan isn't a
            sovereign nation, email me and I'll help you understand why you're
            wrong.
            This means I believe various forms of democracy and rule of the
            people are the only valid forms of governance.
            This means I oppose efforts by the American Republican party to prevent Americans from voting.

            Life is short and should be enjoyed. This means I reject restrictive
            dogmas that demonize human tendencies. This means I celebrate
            good food, friendship, and happiness. This means I reject excessive
            materialism.

            Capitalism bad.
            We should eliminate artificial scarcity,
            and begin planning today for what we intend for
            humans to do when we no longer have to justify our existence
            through labor.

            I like writing, and I think everyone should write occasionally in a
            journal, or even just stream of consciousness. I'd like to write
            sci-fi novels eventually. I'm working on some now, but not with any
            discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus obviously I really like reading, particularly sci-fi novels.

            I like learning about older tools and technologies.
            That means I like
            being the Emacs guy at work. I'm constantly trying to improve my vim
            skills (I use evil-mode in Emacs). I like learning about various GNU
            command line tools, though I still have a lot to learn. I prefer
            building simple, accessible, static webpages whenever the
            opportunity arises. If I can get away with it, I like to write web
            applications in plain old Javascript without any frameworks,
            although this is rarely
            possible. If I can really get away with it, I like building websites
            without any Javascript at all, although this typically just leads to
            me building whatever site in some sort of server-side rendering type
            tool such as Hugo or Django.

            I like playing videogames, sometimes. I'll often go weeks without,
            but then find myself rushing home after work to binge one. I have
            a <a href="http://blog.calebjay.com/tags/gaming/"> couple blog posts
            on the subject</a>.

            I'm starting to learn how to produce electronic music in Ableton. I
            enjoy it but am currently frustratingly bad at it. Here's my

            I really like riding motorcycles. I usually rent a motorcycle when
            I travel.
            So far I've ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam, around a bit in
            Japan, around a bit in the French and Italian Riviera, and around
            a whole lot of Taipei, Taiwan. I'd like to start a sort of Youtube
            channel where I talk about what I'm riding around as I motorcycle
            on a trip. I
            <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/tags/motorcycle/">blog about this.</a>

            I like learning languages. I speak a bit of Japanese and a bit more
            Chinese. Fluency in Mandarin is a 3 year goal for me.

            I love traveling. I can sometimes feel stuck somewhere, and life
            seems very, very short. Traveling alleviates those
            feelings. Plus, I love food, and traveling is a great way to eat.

            I'm idly into horology and am a slow-burning watch collector.
            I <a href="https://blog.calebjay.com/tags/watch/">blog about this, too.</a>
            I enjoy modding watches. My projects so far have been a
            crystal swap on a seiko turtle, a bezel and caseback swap on a Vostok,
            a dial and handswap on a seiko skx007 that ended in disaster, and a failed
            attempt to repair a broken datewheel on a pagani.

            I like meditating. I've been using Headspace a lot recently. It's a
            really good app, and I recommend it!

            I like weightlifting, but the gyms are closed now so I do bodyweight exercises. I recommend reddit's "bodyweightfitness" subreddit.
